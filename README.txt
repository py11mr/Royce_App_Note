# Royce System Application Note Template

This template is maintained in a github reposityory at https://github.com/gb119/Royce_App_Note
 
## Compiling

Most of this is standard LaTeX, but the bibliogrpahy is generated using biber rather than bibtex and you may need to change the
default bibliography setting in your TeX environment to get it to compile the references.

## Adding New Application Notes

For each new application note, please create a new branch in the github repository named after the material to keep the files in. Changes to the template
itself should be made to the master branmch and can then be merged into the individual notes by using git cherry-pick.

## Help

Hopefully, everything else is reasonably self-explanatory - please check with Gavin Burnell if not!
