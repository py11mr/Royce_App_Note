	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Artificial frustrated systems offer a playground to study the emergent properties of interacting systems. Most work to date has been on spatially periodic systems, known as artificial spin ices when the interacting elements are magnetic. Here we have studied artificial magnetic quasicrystals based on quasiperiodic Penrose tiling patterns of interacting nanomagnets. We construct a low-energy configuration from a step-by-step approach that we propose as a ground state. Topologically induced emergent frustration means that this configuration cannot be constructed from vertices in their ground states. It has two parts, a quasi-one-dimensional ‘skeleton' that spans the entire pattern and is capable of long-range order, surrounding ‘flippable' clusters of macrospins that lead to macroscopic degeneracy. Magnetic force microscopy imaging of Penrose tiling arrays revealed superdomains that are larger for more strongly coupled arrays, especially after annealing the array above its blocking temperature.},

	abstract = {A number of different compounds, such as those derived from LaMnO3, have recently been shown to exhibit very large changes (up to 10(6){\%}) in electrical resistance when a magnetic field is applied(1-4)-a phenomenon known as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), But magnetic fields of several tesla are typically required to obtain such a large magnetoresistive effect, thus Limiting the potential for applications. Nevertheless the complex and intimate link between magnetic structure, crystallographic structure and electrical resistivity in CMR materials, in addition to being of fundamental scientific interest, appears to provide some scope for engineering a more sensitive magnetoresistive response. Here we elucidate the effect of specific structural defects on the CMR behaviour of the compound La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. We have made thin film devices that isolate the contribution of a single grain boundary that was introduced into an epitaxial film of the material by growing it on a bicrystal substrate. These devices display sharp resistance switching in magnetic fields orders of magnitude less than those normally associated with CMR. These results both provide insight into the role of grain boundaries, and demonstrate the potential for developing sub-micrometre magnetic field sensors based on the CMR effect.},

@article{Flokstra2015a,
	abstract = {Superconducting spintronics has emerged in the last decade as a promising new field that seeks to open a new dimension for nanoelectronics by utilizing the internal spin structure of the superconducting Cooper pair as a new degree of freedom. Its basic building blocks are spin-triplet Cooper pairs with equally aligned spins, which are promoted by proximity of a conventional superconductor to a ferromagnetic material with inhomogeneous macroscopic magnetization. Using low-energy muon spin rotation experiments, we find an entirely unexpected novel effect: the appearance of a magnetization in a thin layer of a non-magnetic metal (gold), separated from a ferromagnetic double layer by a 50 nm thick superconducting layer of Nb. The effect can be controlled by either temperature or by using a magnetic field to control the state of the remote ferromagnetic elements and may act as a basic building block for a new generation of quantum interference devices based on the spin of a Cooper pair.},

@article{Hueso2007,
	abstract = {Spin electronics (spintronics) exploits the magnetic nature of electrons, and this principle is commercially applied in, for example, the spin valves of disk-drive read heads. There is currently widespread interest in developing new types of spintronic devices based on industrially relevant semiconductors, in which a spin-polarized current flows through a lateral channel between a spin-polarized source and drain(1,2). However, the transformation of spin information into large electrical signals is limited by spin relaxation, so that the magnetoresistive signals are below 1{\%} ( ref. 2). Here we report large magnetoresistance effects (61{\%} at 5 K), which correspond to large output signals ( 65 mV), in devices where the non-magnetic channel is a multiwall carbon nanotube that spans a 1.5 mu m gap between epitaxial electrodes of the highly spin polarized(3,4) manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. This spintronic system combines a number of favourable properties that enable this performance; the long spin lifetime in nanotubes due to the small spin - orbit coupling of carbon; the high Fermi velocity in nanotubes that limits the carrier dwell time; the high spin polarization in the manganite electrodes, which remains high right up to the manganite - nanotube interface; and the resistance of the interfacial barrier for spin injection. We support these conclusions regarding the interface using density functional theory calculations. The success of our experiments with such chemically and geometrically different materials should inspire new avenues in materials selection for future spintronics applications.},

@article{AlMaMari2015,
	abstract = {Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material/'s bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer. This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7).},

@article{Benitez2015,
	abstract = {The microscopic magnetization variation in magnetic domain walls in thin films is a crucial property when considering the torques driving their dynamic behaviour. For films possessing out-of-plane anisotropy normally the presence of N{\'{e}}el walls is not favoured due to magnetostatic considerations. However, they have the right structure to respond to the torques exerted by the spin Hall effect. Their existence is an indicator of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Here we present direct imaging of N{\'{e}}el domain walls with a fixed chirality in device-ready Pt/Co/AlOx films using Lorentz transmission electron and Kerr microscopies. It is shown that any independently nucleated pair of walls in our films form winding pairs when they meet that are difficult to annihilate with field, confirming that they all possess the same topological winding number. The latter is enforced by the DMI. The field required to annihilate these winding wall pairs is used to give a measure of the DMI strength. Such domain walls, which are robust against collisions with each other, are good candidates for dense data storage.},
